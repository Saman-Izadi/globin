- Open prompt to ask user where World of Goo is stored, if the "directory" file hasn't been filled in yet.
- Make copy of World of Goo in the Globin folder.

- Give Globin an interface using PyQt. (Shouldn't be too hard with QtDesigner.)
- Create option to enable and disable mods more freely, like in GooTool.

- Generally improve functionality
- Figure out why Experimental Level Project continues crashing

- LONG TERM: Figure out how to make custom .binuni files
- LONG TERM: Convert .binltl to .binuni?
